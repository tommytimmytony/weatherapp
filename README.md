Welcome to the Weather App, your go-to solution for real-time weather updates and short-term forecasting. Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, this application delivers accurate weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air quality for any city. Our mission is to empower users with reliable weather information to help plan their days effectively.

This semester, our team worked diligently to build a robust application with a responsive design, accommodating multiple user types while ensuring secure and seamless data interactions.

## Process Summary
Our development process was guided by the Agile methodology. Through iterative sprints, we focused on delivering incremental functionality, starting with core features like current weather data and progressively adding enhancements like the 2-day forecast and secure user account management.

User feedback played a critical role in refining our application. We incorporated insights from interviews and feature testing to improve the user interface and resolve key shortcomings

## Accomplishments This Semester
- Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface using React, HTML, and CSS.
- Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display accurate weather data.
- Set up secure data storage and account management using Supabase.
- Enhanced responsiveness to ensure the application performs well across devices.
- Conducted thorough testing to validate features and improve reliability.

## Testing
Manual Testing: Performed exploratory testing to identify UI/UX issues and verified feature performance on different devices.

## FTR and Interview Results
The FTR feedback emphasized improving account security and refining navigation. Interviews revealed that users found the app intuitive but desired a more detailed forecast and account recovery options. These insights led us to enhance the UI and add additional security features.

## Analysis Based on Interviews
From user interviews, we identified a need to simplify the sign-up process and provide clearer error messages. If given more time, we would focus on streamlining these areas to improve user satisfaction further.
